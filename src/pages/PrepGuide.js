                    In this section, you will find information about selecting high school courses that best prepare you for liberal arts colleges
                    with high academic demands, such as Harvard, as well as tips for deciding whether you should take time off before attending college.

                    <div className="pg6">While we believe that the conclusions summarized on this page will meet the expectations of many other selective colleges, let us say a word about Harvard, since it was here that the data underlying our conclusions were gathered.

                        This overview is not intended to provide a formula that will ensure admission to Harvard. Our admissions policies are based on many criteria. Some are academic; others are not.

                        Our Admissions Office chooses carefully from a broad range of applicants who seem to us to offer the most promise for future contributions to society. Not all of the students who are best prepared for college will be among those with the most future promise, nor are all of the most promising well prepared academically.

                        While the heart of the matter will always lie in academic promise, we prize candidates with special talents and with outstanding personal qualities; we are interested in students who excel in one or more extracurricular activities; and we seek a distinctive and diverse national and international student body.
              
                        We believe that you should prepare for college by mastering certain subjects and skills. You can demonstrate your proficiency in these subjects by taking Advanced Placement tests and International Baccalaureate tests and submitting the scores, if you wish

                <div className="pge11">Application Fee Waiver</div>
                <div className="pge12">The application fee covers a very small portion of the administrative costs of processing
                    applications. However, if the fee presents a hardship for you or your family, it will be waived.
                    Each applicant applying with a fee waiver should select an option for a need-based fee waiver.
                        Do not let the admissions application fee prevent you from applying! In the spirit of our honor code, if the
                        admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. Please follow the
                        steps below to request a fee waiver:

                <div className="pge11">Family</div>
                <div className="pge12">In the family section, you'll share information about your household, your parents, and any siblings. Most colleges collect this information for demographic purposes. Even if you're an adult or an emancipated minor, you'll need to fill out this section.Answer the questions as honestly and fully as you can,
                    but don't worry if you and your parent/guardian do not know all of the details about your family.
                    Part of an admissions officer's job in reading your application is to understand your background and how these
                    circumstances have affected your upbringing, the opportunities available to you, academic preparation,
                    and other factors relevant to the college admissions process.
                    Family life is an important factor in helping us to learn more about the circumstances and conditions in which
                    you were raised, and how you have made the most of the opportunities provided by your family. We want to
                    understand where you're coming from, not only in school,
                    but at home as well.Parents almost always have a significant effect on students' lives. Information about parents
                    may indicate challenges you have faced - and overcome. In your essay you might elaborate on your family experiences in a wide variety of ways that can illuminate your character and personal qualities, including the positive aspects of your family life.</div>

            <div className="pge1">
                <div className="pge11">Education</div>
                <div className="pge12">In the Education section is where you will share information about your current school or
                    coursework, academic honors, and future education plans. Here are some tips on commonly asked questions.
                  It is not uncommon for students to change schools or take time off during high school. While this information will most likely appear on your transcript, hearing directly from you about any interruption in schooling will help us to fill in any gaps
                    We always defer to the secondary school report for information about grades. If yours is not provided by the counselor or school, we will take into consideration what is self-reported, making sure to confirm with your school officials.
                    Please list the courses you are currently taking and/or are planning on taking before you graduate. If your schedule changes after you have submitted your application, please keep us updated by submitting additional materials in the Applicant Portal.
                    This is a place to highlight any achievements or awards you have received. If you receive any significant honors or awards after submitting the application, you may notify us by submitting additional materials in the Applicant Portal and we will include this information with your application materials.
                    You do not need to have a ten year plan, but getting a sense of what kinds of professions you have considered gives us insight into your current plans. Don't fret about it: put a few ideas down and move on with your application.

                    Since there are some students who do have a developed career interest already established while they are in high school, this question provides an opportunity to indicate such a plan.

            <div className="pge1">
                <div className="pge11">Activities</div>
                <div className="pge12">he activities section gives you the opportunity to tell schools more about who you are and
                    activities you're involved with outside the classroom. You'll have the opportunity to list up to ten activities,
                    but that doesn't mean you need to enter all ten.We are much more interested in the quality of students' activities than their quantity so do not feel you need to fill in the entire grid! Contributions students make to the well-being of their secondary schools, communities and families are of great interest to us. So indicate for us the time you spend and the nature of the contribution to extracurricular activities, the local community, work experiences and help provided to your family. Activities you undertake need not be exotic but rather might show a commitment to excellence regardless of the activity. Such a commitment can apply to any activity in your life and may reflect underlying character and personal qualities.

                    For example, a student can gain a great deal from helping his or her family with babysitting or other household
                    responsibilities or working in a restaurant to help with family or personal expenses. Such experiences are
                    important "extracurricular" activities and can be detailed in the extracurricular section and discussed in essays.

                    Some students list only activities they feel will appear significant to the admissions office,
                    while others endeavor to list every single thing they have ever done. Neither approach is right for everyone.
                    Rather, you should think about the activities (in-school, at home, or elsewhere) that you care most about and
                    devote most of your time doing, and list those.

                    We realize that extracurricular and athletic opportunities are either unavailable or limited at many high schools.
                    We also know that limited economic resources in many families can affect a student's chances for participation on
                    the school teams, travel teams, or even prevent participation at all due to the costs of the equipment or the
                    logistical requirements of some sports and activities. You should not feel that your chances for admission to
                    college are hindered by the lack of extracurricular opportunities. Rather, our admissions committee will look at
                    the various kinds of opportunities you have had in your lifetime and try to assess how well you have taken
                    advantage of those opportunities.</div></div>
